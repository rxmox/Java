1. Run the tests Quiz2ExampleTest.java.
2. Fix CalgaryProperty.java, ResidentialProperty.java, and StandardFormatting.java so that all tests pass. You should not modify Quiz2ExampleTest.java.
3. Submit the corrected files following the general submission instructions.

Approximately 15 errors have been introduced. Two errors are syntax errors which will prevent the code from being compiled. The remaining errors will cause tests to fail but will not prevent compilation.  You will need to correct some syntax errors before the tests can be run. Use the same process used in Lab C to correct debug the code.

Tip: We will use the same tests provided in Quiz2ExampleTest.java to mark your code, but potentially with different testing values. Your grade will be based on the number of tests passed when run against the test file. Therefore, ALL syntax errors must be corrected to receive any points.

You may receive zero if:
- Any submitted Java file does not compile
- Your submission is in the wrong format
- You do not include the correct package declaration (edu.ucalgary.oop)
- You do not submit all required files: CalgaryProperty.java, ResidentialProperty.java, and Standardformatting.java
- You submit any files other than the required files. DO NOT SUBMIT Quiz2ExampleTest.java!
