Assignment 2 Grading Rubric (21 marks)

Skills evaluated:
- Attention to detail (implementation from a UML diagram)
- Implemention of various relationships between classes
- Writing a custom exception
- Use of multiple files, dependencies
- Use of packages

You may receive zero if:
- Your code does not compile
- Your submission is in the wrong format
- You do not include the correct package declaration
- You do not use the specified visibility, names, etc. shown in the UML diagram
- You submit any files other than Pet.java, Client.java, RewardsProfile.java, Booking.java, ReportCard.java, Employee.java, CareProfile.java, EmergVet.java, InvalidRewardsNumException.java

Each method is expected to meet the requirements provided in the diagram (takes the specified arguments, returns the correct type, etc.).
The public methods will be evaluated as follows (note that sometimes additional methods will be used to achieve the desired result, e.g., PetNameInBookingTest will use getBookedPet().getName()):

Relationship between Pet and EmergVet
1 mark: EmergVet information can be constructed outside of Pet class [EmergVetConstructTest]
2 marks: EmergVet name and phone number can be accessed through getVet in Pet class [EmergNameInPetTest, EmergVetNumberInPetTest]

Relationship between Pet and Client
3 marks: Client name, phone number, and address can be accessed through getOwner in Pet class with Client getters [ClientAddresInPetTest, ClientNameInPetTest, ClientNumberInPetTest]
1 mark: Client information can be accessed even after assigned Pet has been deleted [ClientNoInfoPetTest]

Relationship between RewardsProfile and Client
1 mark: Before enrolling, getRewardsNumber in Client returns the correct default string [NotEnrolledRewardsTest]
1 mark: After enrolling, getRewardsPoints in Client returns the correct default points total [DefaultRewardsPointsTest]
1 mark: Rewards points can be updated through updatePoints in Client [AddingRewardsPointsTest]

If rewards number is invalid, throw a custom exception
1 mark: enrollRewards catches a custom exception from the RewardsProfile constructor if an invalid rewards number is provided as input [InvalidRewardsNumberTest]
1 mark: RewardsProfile constructor throws a custom exception if an invalid rewards number is provided as input [RewardsExceptionThrownTest]

Relationship between Employee and Pet -- linked through Booking
1 mark: getCaregiver will return the correct Employee name in Booking [EmployeeNameInBookingTest]
1 mark: getBookedPet will return the correct Pet name in Booking [PetNameInBookingTest]

Relationship between ReportCard and Booking
2 marks: printReport in ReportCard returns the correct String using the pet and assigned employee name
You may receive part marks for the correct contents even if your output does not quite follow the given spacing requirements (i.e. contains an extra new line, wrong punctuation/capitalization, etc.) 
[2 tests within ReportCardTest]

Relationship between Pet and CareProfile
2 marks: setCare will correctly update the med list and care notes, getCareSummary will print the given medlist and care notes in the specified format
You may receive part marks for the correct contents even if your output does not quite follow the given spacing requirements (i.e. contains an extra new line, wrong punctuation/capitalization, etc.) 
[2 tests within CareProfileTest]

Relationship between Employee and self
1 mark: getManagerID returns null if an Employee has no manager [EmployeeNoManagerTest]
1 mark: getManagerID returns the correct ID after set through initalization [EmployeeGetManagerTest]
1 mark: getEmployees returns the full array of assigned employee names for a manager (max of 10 employees) [GetEmployeesTest]
